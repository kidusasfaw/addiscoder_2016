<b>Exercise 4</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
Define a function flooredSquareRoot(n) which takes a positive int or long n and 
computes its square root, rounded down to the nearest integer. Python has a 
built-in sqrt function which could be helpful here, but donâ€™t use it.

CONSTRAINTS
For test cases worth 10 points:
0 &le; N &le; 10 for 2 test cases worth a total of 20 points.
0 &le; n &le; 10,000,000,000 for 4 other test cases worth a total of 80 points.

TIME LIMIT
100 milliseconds for all test cases.

INPUT FORMAT
A single line containing the integer, N.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single line containing the square root of N, rounded down to the nearest integer.
