<pre>
Write a function <string>fromListToMatrix()</strong> which takes an adjacency list representation
of a graph and outputs an adjacency matrix representation of the same graph. 

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. 

INPUT FORMAT
The input will be a number n which represents the number of nodes in the graph. Following n
will be a sorted list of nodes for which an edge from node zero to that node. The next line
will be a similar list for node 1 and so on until node n.



OUTPUT FORMAT
A nested list representing the adjacency matrix form of the graph.

SAMPLE INPUT
3
1
2

The corresponding graph would be 
 0 -> 1 -> 2


SAMPLE OUTPUT
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1], [0,0,0]]
