 <pre class="problemtext">

Write a function distance(A, i, j) which takes an adjacency list A and two
vertices i,j, and outputs the length of the shortest path from i to j in the
graph represented by A. This can be done by modifying the code for bfs to keep
track of distances.


Constraints
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= M <= 250000


INPUT FORMAT
A single line containing N, M, i, j for N the number of vertics and M the
number of lines following. Then, M lines containing two integers: the start
and end vertices.

The vertices are labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.


OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer that is the shortest distance from i to j, or -1 if there
is path from i to j.
