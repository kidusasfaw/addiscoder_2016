<pre>
Write a functionpath(A, i, j) which takes an adjacency list A and two vertices i,j, and
outputs a path from i to j in the graph represented by A in list form, or [] if no such path
exists. For example, if we can get from vertex 0 to 5 by taking the sequence of edges 
(0;1);(1;4);(4;7);(7;5)in some graph, then the function should return thelist[0, 1, 4, 7, 5]. 

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. 

INPUT FORMAT
The input will be two nodes i and j and an adjacency list represented a number n which represents the number of 
nodes in the graph. Following n will be a sorted list of nodes for which an edge from node
zero to that node. The next line will be a similar list for node 1 and so on until node n.



OUTPUT FORMAT
A list representing the path from node i to node j if one exists. Otherwise an empty list

SAMPLE INPUT
0 3
4
1
2
3


The corresponding graph would be 
 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3


SAMPLE OUTPUT
[0,1,2,3]
