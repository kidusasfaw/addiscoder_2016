<b>Problem mostActivities</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
There are n possible activities that you can do throughout the day. Each
activity has a start time a_i and a finish time b_i. You cannot participate in
two activities if they overlap. Calculate the most number of activities that
you could participate in. That is, write a function mostActivities(L) where L
is of the form [[a_1, b_1], [a_2, b_2], ..., [a_n, b_n]], and where
mostActivities(L) outputs the largest number of activities that you could
participate in.

This problem can be solved using both memoization and the greedy method.
What's the running time you get for each method?
