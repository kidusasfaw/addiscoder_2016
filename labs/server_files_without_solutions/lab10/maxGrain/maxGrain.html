  <pre class="problemtext">

You have a bag that can hold W kilograms of stuff. You're at a grain store
where you pay only by the total weight of items you buy and not by the total
value of the grains, so you want to pack your bag as well as possible to
maximize the total value of goods you take. The store has a separate container
for each type of grain, and there are w pounds available of each grain, and
those w pounds in total are worth v dollars. The grains have all been powdered,
so it is easy to take any number of pounds of a grain which is at most w.

Write a function maxGrain(L, W) which takes a list
L = [[v_1, w_1 ], [v_2 , w_2 ], ..., [v_n , w_n]] of the values and weights
of all the grain containers, and outputs a number which is the maximum number
of dollars worth of grain you can take out of the store in your weight-W bag.

Your output should be a float. You can convert an int x to a float in Python
by either multiplying it by 1.0, or typing float(x).

CONSTRAINTS
0 <= N <= 10000
0 <= W <= 100000
0 <= v_i <= 50000
0 <= w_i <= 50000
The time limits will vary per case, with a maximum of 500ms.

INPUT FORMAT
A single line containing N and W.
N lines containing two numbers, v_i and w_i.


OUTPUT FORMAT
A single float that is the maximum dollar worth of grain you can take out.
