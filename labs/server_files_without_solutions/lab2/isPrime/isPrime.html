<pre class="problemtext">
Recall, an integer is prime if it is larger than 1 and it
has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Write a function
<b>isPrime(n)</b> which returns <b>True</b> if <b>n</b> is
prime, and returns <b>False</b> otherwise. Then, write a
function <b>listOfPrimes(n)</b> which returns a list of
all primes, in order, between 2 and <b>n</b> - you might
want to call the function <b>isPrime</b> from within
<b>listOfPrimes</b>. Notice that if you try to run
<b>listOfPrimes</b> on a large number, it will take a long
time. Is there a way to write <b>isPrime</b> so that
<b>listOfPrimes(n)</b> takes only a few seconds to return
its result when <b>n</b> is 1000000?
