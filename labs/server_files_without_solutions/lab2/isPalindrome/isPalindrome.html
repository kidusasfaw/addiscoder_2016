<pre class="problemtext">
An integer is said to be a palindrome if its digits are
the same forward and backwards(not including leading
zeroes). For example, 12321 is a palindrome, as is 5. 1231
on the other hand is not a palindrome, and neither is 50
(remember we are not including leading zeroes). Write a 
function <b>isPalindrome(n)</b> which returns True if n is 
a palindrome and False otherwise.

CONSTRAINTS
