<b>Problem evaluate</b>

<pre class="problemtext">

An expression is defined recursively as follows. An integer is an expression,
which evaluates to the integer itself. If EXPR is an expression, then so is
(EXPR), and it evaluates to whatever EXPR evaluated to. Finally, if EXPR1 and
EXPR2 are expressions, then (OP EXPR1 EXPR2) is an expression, where OP can
be any one of +, -, *, and it evaluates to evaluate(EXPR1) OP evaluate(EXPR2).
You should write a function evaluate which takes a str and evaluates the
expression it is a valid expression, and outputs "INVALID" if it is not a
valid expression.
