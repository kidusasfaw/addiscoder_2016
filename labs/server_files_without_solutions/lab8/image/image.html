<b>Problem B</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
You are given a 2D-image drawn using 10 colors. Each color is represented by an
integer from 0 to 9. The image is described by giving the color of each pixel in the image. Two
pixels are adjacent if one is immediately to the left of the other or immediately above the other.
The image consists of many objects, and two pixels are part of the same object if they are adjacent
and have the same color. The area of an object is the number of pixels it has. Find the area of the
largest object in the image.

CONSTRAINTS
<i>N,M</i> &le; 100.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input is in the format N M, where N is the number of rows and M the number of
columns. The next N lines are then each M characters long (space-separated) and describe the colors
in the image.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each test case, print the area of the largest object in the image, followed by a
newline
