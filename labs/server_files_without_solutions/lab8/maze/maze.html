<b>Problem B</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
You are in a 2D-maze. Find the shortest way to get from the start location
to the end location. The starting location is specified by 'S', and the 
ending location by 'E'. A cell with '.' represents an empty square, and you
can walk through it. A cell with '#' represents a wall, and you cannot walk 
through it. From any given cell, you can walk either up, down, left, or right, 
provided that you don't walk outside the maze or into a wall. Find the shortest 
path from the starting location to the end location.

CONSTRAINTS
N,M â‰¤ 100

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. (2x for Java, 15x for Python)

INPUT FORMAT
The first line gives N M , the dimensions of the maze (N is the number of rows, 
and M is the number of columns). The next N lines are then each M characters 
long and give the layout of the maze.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Print a single integer representing the length of the shortest path from the 
start to end location. If there is no way to get from the start to the end, 
print -1.
