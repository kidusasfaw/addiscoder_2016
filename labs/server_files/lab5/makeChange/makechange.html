<b> Exercise 1: </b>

<pre class="problemtext">

Modify the memoized makeChange implementation so that it doesn't just tell you the minimum number of coins that are needed to make change, but instead it returns a list of which coins you should use to make change using the fewest number of coins.

Namely, given an integer n and a list L of the coin denominations, print a list of which coins (and how many) to use to make change for n using the fewest number of coins possible. Assume you have an infinite supply of coins.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 < n < 1000
1 < len(L) < 100

INPUT:
A single line containing an integer n, followed by an integer len(L), followed by len(L) integers representing the list L.

OUTPUT:
The smallest possible list (in non-strictly increasing order) of coins that sum to n.

SAMPLE INPUT:
12 2 1 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
2 2 2 2 2 2
