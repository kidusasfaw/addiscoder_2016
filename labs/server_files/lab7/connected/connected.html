<pre class="problemtext">
You are given N adjacency lists, each representing one graph. An adjacency list A represents
a graph G with V vertices and E edges, where the vertices are labeled 0,1,...,V-1.

Write a function <b>connected(A,i,j)</b> which takes an adjacency
list A and two vertices i,j, and outputs True if there is a
path connecting i to j in the graph G represented by A, and
outputs False otherwise. All vertices are guaranteed to have at
least one neighbor.

CONSTRAINTS
N &le; 5
V &le; 10<sup>4</sup> for all test cases (where V is the number of vertices in G)
E &le; 10<sup>5</sup> for all test cases (where E is the number of edges in G)

TIME LIMIT
200ms, for cases where graphs have at most 1000 vertices.
400ms, for cases where graphs have at most 10000 vertices.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input contains a single integer N, the number of graph problems.

The remainder of the input is divided into N sections, each representing a single
graph problem (a graph given by an adjacency list, and a query of whether or not
two given vertices are connected). The first line of each section contains three
space separated integers, V, i, and j. Each of the next V lines describes the
neighbors of vertices 0,1,...,V-1, in that order, as a space-separated list of
indices.

Each section follows directly from the previous, without any separation.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each query, please output True on a new line if the two given vertices are
connected, and False on a new line otherwise.
