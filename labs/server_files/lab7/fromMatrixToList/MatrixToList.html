<pre>
Write a function <strong>fromMatrixToList()</strong> which takes an adjacency matrix 
representation of a graph and outputs an adjacency list representation of the same graph. 

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. 

INPUT FORMAT
An adjacency matrix represented as a nested list where the first element of the outer list
represents the connections from node zero to all the other nodes in the graph.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A nested list representing the adjacency list form of the graph.

SAMPLE INPUT
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1], [0,0,0]]


The corresponding graph would be 
 0 -> 1 -> 2


SAMPLE OUTPUT
[[1],[2],[]]
