<pre>
Write a function <string>fromListToMatrix()</strong> which takes an adjacency list representation
of a graph and outputs an adjacency matrix representation of the same graph. 

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. 

INPUT FORMAT
A graph in adjacency list representation formatted as a nested python list. The fist element
in the outer list is a list the holds the nodes that are adjacent to node 0.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Adjacency matrix form the input graph as a binary nested list.

SAMPLE INPUT
[[1],[2],[]]

The corresponding graph would be 
 0 -> 1 -> 2


SAMPLE OUTPUT
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1], [0,0,0]]
