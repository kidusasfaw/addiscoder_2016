<b>Lab 1 Exercise 3</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
Given a list or string x, output x concatenated with itself.

Note: You should write a single function doubleIt(x) to take care of both the 
list and string cases.

CONSTRAINTS
For all test cases:
0 &le; len(x) &le; 50000

TIME LIMIT
120 milliseconds per test case.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line will have either a 'S' or a 'L' to denote whether the input is 
a string or a list.

Cases that start with a 'S' will have a single line that contains the string.

Cases that start with a 'L' will be followed by an integer denoting the length 
of the list, followed by each element of the list in each of the subsequent 
lines of the file.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Either a single line containing the concatenated string or each of the 
elements of the concatenated list on its own line.
