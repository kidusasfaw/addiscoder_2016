<b>Problem B</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
Python already has a function reverse() for lists (L.reverse() reverses the list L). Let's implement
our own reverse() function using recursion. reverse(L) should be a recursive function that outputs
a list which contains the elements of L in reverse. Remember that L[i:] evaluates to a list containing
only the elements of L from index i onwards.

CONSTRAINTS
The length of the list must be between 0 and 20 inclusive.

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input is T, the number of test cases. Then, for each of the T test
cases, there is one line with the list elements such that L[0] appears first, L[1] appears second etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each test case, print one line with the list elements such that L[0] appears last, L[1] appears second from last etc.
