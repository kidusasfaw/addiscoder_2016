<b>Exercise 2</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
The factorial of n is n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n (we define 0! = 1). Implement factorial(n)
to compute the factorial of n.

CONSTRAINTS
0 &le; N &le; 20 for 3 test cases worth a total of 30 points.
0 &le; N &le; 50 for 2 test cases worth a total of 40 points.
0 &le; N &le; 900 for the final test case worth 30 points.

TIME LIMIT
150 milliseconds per test case.

INPUT FORMAT
A single line containing the integer, N.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single line containing the factorial of N.
