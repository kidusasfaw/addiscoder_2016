<b>Exercise 5</b>

<pre class="problemtext">
Given M integer intervals, take the unions of the intervals (with 
repetition) and find the N-th smallest number.

More specifically, implement a function calcNthSmallest(N, intervals) which 
takes as input a non- negative int N, and a list of intervals 
[[A1, B1], ..., [Am, Bm]] and calculates the nth smallest number (0-indexed) 
when taking the union of all the intervals with repetition. 

CONSTRAINTS
0 &le; A &le; B &le; 20 for 1 test case worth 10 points.
0 &le; A &le; B &le; 10,000,000 for 3 test cases worth total 60 points.
0 &le; A &le; B &le; 1,000,000,000,000 for one last test case worth 30 points.

TIME LIMIT
150 milliseconds per test case.

INPUT FORMAT
The first line is N, the index of the number we want to find.
The next line is M, the number of intervals. 
Next M lines each contains Ai and Bi, which marks bounds of the i-th interval.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single line containing the N-th smallest number in the union.

SAMPLE INPUT
2
3
1 5
2 4
7 9

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2

DETAILS
In the sample, the intervals are [1,5],[2,4],[7,9], which represents the
integers {1,2,3,4,5}, {2,3,4}, and {7,8,9}, respectively. Their sorted union
with repetition would be {1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8,9}. Note that 2,3,4 each appear 
twice since theyâ€™re in both the intervals [1, 5] and [2, 4]. For this list of 
intervals, the 0th smallest number would be 1, the 1st smallest number would 
be 2, and the 2nd smallest would be 2.
