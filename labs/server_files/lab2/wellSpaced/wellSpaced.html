<pre class="problemtext">
Let's call an integer well-spaced if when you write down
its prime factorization, you don't need to use two
adjacent primes. For example, 10 is well-spaced since 10 =
2 &times; 5, and 2,5 are not adjacent primes since the
prime 3 is in between them. However, 6 is not well-spaced,
since 6 = 2 &times; 3, and 2,3 are adjacent primes, and
neither is 154 = 2 &times 7 &times; 11, since 7,11 are adjacent primes. Any
prime number itself is of course also well-spaced. Write a
function <b>wellSpaced(n)</b> which returns True if n is
well-spaced, and returns False otherwise.
