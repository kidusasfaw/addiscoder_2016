<pre>
The US coin denominations are 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents.  To minimize the number of coins
needed to make change in cents, it is always optimal to repeatedly take coin of highest 
value possible. Write a function <strong>makeChange(n)</strong> which outputs the list 
of coins one should use to make change for <i>n</i> cents using US coins.

CONSTRAINTS
For all test cases:
0 > n < 1,000,000

TIME LIMIT
1 second per test case. 

INPUT FORMAT
An integer representing the the total value in cents that need to be represented in as few
coins as possible.

OUTPUT FORMAT
A reverse sorted space separated list of the coins.

SAMPLE INPUT
31

SAMPLE OUTPUT
25 5 1
